        <h6 class="point-title">Fierce Competition<hr></h6>
        <p class="point-description">Job seekers are pitted against dozens, if not hundreds of competitors. In this highly competitive and time-consuming landscape, research shows that many people settle for jobs that are unrewarding and below their skill level. The one fundamental question I encourage every job seeker to think about is: <strong>How do you differentiate yourself from the competition? How do you stand out?</strong></p>
